        "The AI agent successfully processed two sample customer emails (one urgent, one normal) through a series of mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Email Definition**: Two distinct sample emails were created: an urgent email concerning \"Unauthorized Activity Detected on Your Account!\" and a normal email inquiring \"Regarding My Recent Order #12345\".\n",
        "*   **Email Classification**:\n",
        "    *   The **urgent email** was accurately classified with an urgency of 'urgent' and a topic of 'account security'.\n",
        "    *   The **normal email** was accurately classified with an urgency of 'normal' and a topic of 'order inquiry'.\n",
        "*   **Documentation Search**:\n",
        "    *   For the urgent email's topic ('account security'), the agent simulated finding documentation: \"Documentation: Steps to secure your account and report suspicious activity.\"\n",
        "    *   For the normal email's topic ('order inquiry'), the agent simulated finding documentation: \"Documentation: How to track your order and check delivery status.\"\n",
        "*   **Response Drafting**: The agent implemented a response drafting mechanism. For topics other than 'password reset' (which was not triggered by the sample emails), it generated a generic placeholder response, indicating that specific responses are under development.\n",
        "*   **Escalation Identification**:\n",
        "    *   The **urgent email** was correctly identified as requiring escalation (True), due to its 'urgent' classification and 'account security' topic.\n",
        "    *   The **normal email** was correctly identified as *not* requiring immediate escalation (False).\n",
        "*   **Follow-up Identification**:\n",
        "    *   Neither the **urgent email** (topic: 'account security') nor the **normal email** (topic: 'order inquiry') were identified as requiring immediate follow-up based on the predefined follow-up topics (e.g., 'technical support', 'API integration errors', 'billing issue').\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Expand Response Drafting Logic**: Implement specific response drafting logic for other common topics identified by the classification model (e.g., 'account security', 'order inquiry') beyond just 'password reset', leveraging the documentation snippets to provide more helpful initial responses.\n",
        "*   **Refine Follow-up and Escalation Rules**: Enhance the rules for identifying follow-up and escalation to consider more nuanced scenarios or combinations of urgency and topic, potentially using sentiment analysis or keyword extraction for deeper insight.\n"
